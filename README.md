## 🛠️ Tools Included

### 1. Server Consolidation Calculator
- Calculate rack space and power savings by migrating legacy servers to high-density AMD solutions.
- Visualizes rack footprint reduction.

### 2. Data Center Capital Cost
- Estimates total construction capital cost based on capacity (kW) and power density.
- Breaks down costs by power, cooling, and IT infrastructure.

### 3. Lifecycle CO2e Estimator
- comprehensive carbon footprint calculator covering Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.
- Visualizes 15-year lifecycle carbon impact.

### 4. TCO Comparison Tool
- Compares Traditional vs. Modern infrastructure costs over a 10-year period.
- Identifies the ROI break-even point.

### 5. Power Path Efficiency (AC vs. DC)
- Compares end-to-end efficiency across Legacy AC, Modern AC, and 380V DC architectures.

### 6. Cooling Capacity Analysis
- Determines required cooling capacity (Tons) and airflow (CFM) based on IT load.
